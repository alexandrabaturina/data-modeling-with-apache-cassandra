# Data Engineering ND #2: Data Modeling With Apache Cassandra
## Overview
Data Modeling With Apache Cassandra is the second project of Udacity [Data Engineering Nanodegree](https://d20vrrgs8k4bvw.cloudfront.net/documents/en-US/Data+Engineering+Nanodegree+Program+Syllabus.pdf). It requires to create an [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html) database for a music streaming app and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from directory of CSV files into this database using Python and [CQL](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/cql/index.html).

The project has the following goals:
 * Model a NoSQL database with [Apache Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/_/index.html)
 * Perform insert and select queries using [CQL](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/cql/index.html)
 * Create ETL pipeline with Python
